              <p>Hello, My name is Samuel Hurh and I am a junior studying computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with particular interest in the fields of XR and AI/ML. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>My explorations of AI/ML have been primarily through the practical application of it like computer vision. They say that AI makes hard problems easy and easy problems hard so an individual combining their capabilities in regular software engineering with appropriate applications of AI/ML would be a force multiplier when it comes to creating new and innovative solutions. One does not necessarily need to be a replacement for the other. To learn more about this field, I have obtained a Google Tensorflow Certificate and am currently taking related coursework.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On top of that, I’ve also been quite invested in XR technologies particularly in my interests outside of class. As someone who has experience with human-centered-design, It’s interesting to see how our understanding of human-computer interface is changing with XR technologies. Just like how mouse cursors, keyboard inputs, and GUI brought personal computing to the average person, VR/AR headsets and their methods of input are optimizing every day in order to find common denominators among the population to target for ease-of-use. I actually have experience in this field working on a research project under the  UIUC computer science department on gaze-depth-based interaction/actuation where gaze-depth interaction is being studied as a potential addition to the AR/VR user interface.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On the side, I’ve taken up particular interest in web development, computer graphics, and game development. Expect to see more projects related to these topics in my portfolio in the future.
            </p>
